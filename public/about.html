<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I go by Daz. Im a junior web developer, private pilot aspiring to get into the airlines and love everything tech! </p>

<p>I've made this website to show a little about myself! I am showcasing what I learnt about HTML so that I can tell you all about myself! How cool is that!</p>

<p>My hobbies include flying, gaming, programming, going on hikes and everything tech related! Currently I have the latest Samsung S23 Ultra, since I am an android fan (ew Apple lol!).</p>
